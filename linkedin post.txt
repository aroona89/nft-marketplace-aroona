Alhamdulillah! Exciting Project Milestone Achieved🎯

I'm thrilled to announce that my 𝗡𝗙𝗧 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 is now live!🚀
Project-based learning poses significant challenges for newcomers with substantial knowledge gaps, and I'm proud to have bridged that gap and successfully completed the project, demonstrating my growth and commitment. 💌 


📄 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
The application is a React-based NFT marketplace that leverages the OpenSea API. Users can explore different NFT collections, view all NFTs within a specific collection, and access detailed information about a particular NFT.

𝗛𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲: Displays a list of NFT collections with essential details and links to their respective collection pages.
𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲: Showcases all NFTs within a specific collection with basic information and links to individual NFT detail pages.
𝗡𝗙𝗧 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲: Provides comprehensive information about a specific NFT, including attributes, owner details, and additional metadata, with an option to view the NFT on the OpenSea website.


🛠 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
This project utilizes a modern front-end development stack including:

𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 (for building dynamic and reusable UI components)
𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 (ensures type safety and reduces errors)
𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗦𝗦 (provides a utility-first approach to styling)
𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝘅 (helps manage complex application state effectively)
𝗔𝘅𝗶𝗼𝘀 (facilitates fetching data from APIs for a seamless user experience)


🏄‍♀️𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 (𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜) 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹:
𝗙𝗲𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗔𝗣𝗜: Axios makes HTTP requests to the OpenSea API, retrieving the desired NFT data.
𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝘅: The fetched data is then stored in the Redux store using actions and reducers. This makes the data accessible to different components of application.
𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶𝗻 𝗨𝗜: React components access the data from the Redux store using custom hook & useAppSelector to populate the user interface.
